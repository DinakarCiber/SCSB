CAS: The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on protocol for the web. Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user id and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password. 

SCSB-CAS is a microservice application that acts as authentication for the SCSB application from the developerâ€™s endpoint.
